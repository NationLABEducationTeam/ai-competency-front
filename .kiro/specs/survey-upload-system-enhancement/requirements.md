# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on analyzing and enhancing the survey upload system in the AI Capability Assessment platform. The current system allows administrators to upload Excel files containing survey questions to S3, which are then parsed and served to students through a Google Forms-like interface. While the basic functionality works, there are several areas that need improvement in terms of architecture, error handling, user experience, and maintainability.

## Current System Analysis

### Strengths of Current Implementation:
1. **Working End-to-End Flow**: The system successfully handles the complete flow from Excel upload to student survey completion
2. **S3 Integration**: Direct S3 SDK integration for file storage and retrieval
3. **Excel Parsing**: Functional Excel file parsing using XLSX library
4. **Multi-Environment Support**: Different API endpoints for development and production
5. **Progress Tracking**: Student survey progress with step-by-step navigation
6. **AI Analysis Integration**: Basic AI analysis of survey responses

### Areas Needing Enhancement:
1. **Error Handling**: Inconsistent error handling across components
2. **File Validation**: Limited validation of uploaded Excel files
3. **User Experience**: Upload process lacks proper feedback and validation
4. **Code Organization**: Mixed concerns and repeated logic
5. **Security**: Direct S3 credentials exposure in frontend
6. **Performance**: No optimization for large files or concurrent uploads
7. **Monitoring**: Limited logging and error tracking

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want a robust and user-friendly Excel file upload system, so that I can easily create surveys with proper validation and feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator uploads an Excel file THEN the system SHALL validate the file format and structure before processing
2. WHEN uploading a file THEN the system SHALL display real-time progress indicators and status updates
3. WHEN a file upload fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with specific guidance on how to fix issues
4. WHEN a file is successfully uploaded THEN the system SHALL preview the parsed questions for administrator review
5. WHEN validating Excel files THEN the system SHALL check for required columns, data types, and content completeness

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want secure and scalable file upload architecture, so that the system can handle multiple concurrent uploads without security risks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling file uploads THEN the system SHALL use secure authentication methods instead of exposing AWS credentials in the frontend
2. WHEN multiple users upload files simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent uploads without conflicts
3. WHEN storing files THEN the system SHALL implement proper S3 key naming conventions and organization
4. WHEN processing uploads THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting and file size restrictions
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for debugging and monitoring

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want comprehensive error handling and recovery options, so that I can resolve issues quickly and maintain system reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN upload errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages with actionable solutions
2. WHEN network issues interrupt uploads THEN the system SHALL implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
3. WHEN S3 operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide fallback options and recovery procedures
4. WHEN Excel parsing fails THEN the system SHALL identify specific issues in the file structure and content
5. WHEN system errors occur THEN the system SHALL maintain detailed logs for troubleshooting

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want well-organized and maintainable code architecture, so that the system is easy to understand, modify, and extend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN the system SHALL have clear separation of concerns between components
2. WHEN implementing new features THEN the system SHALL follow consistent patterns and conventions
3. WHEN handling different file operations THEN the system SHALL use reusable utility functions and services
4. WHEN managing state THEN the system SHALL use appropriate state management patterns
5. WHEN testing the system THEN the system SHALL have comprehensive test coverage for critical functions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want enhanced survey management capabilities, so that I can efficiently organize and maintain multiple surveys across different workspaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing surveys THEN the system SHALL provide bulk operations for survey management
2. WHEN organizing surveys THEN the system SHALL support categorization and tagging
3. WHEN viewing survey lists THEN the system SHALL provide advanced filtering and search capabilities
4. WHEN handling survey templates THEN the system SHALL support template creation and reuse
5. WHEN monitoring survey performance THEN the system SHALL provide analytics on upload success rates and common issues
