# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing AI Capability Assessment System by focusing on areas that need improvement based on analysis of the current implementation. The system already has core functionality for survey creation, Excel file upload for questions, student survey completion, and basic result storage. This enhancement will build upon these existing features to provide more advanced analytics, improved reporting capabilities, and a better user experience for both administrators and students.

## Current System Analysis

### Already Implemented Features:
1. **Survey Creation and Management**:
   - Creating surveys with title, description, and scale settings
   - Uploading Excel files with survey questions
   - Manual question addition and editing
   - Survey activation/deactivation

2. **Student Survey Experience**:
   - Personal information collection
   - Multi-page survey with 5 questions per page
   - Progress tracking during survey completion
   - Thank you page after completion

3. **Basic Data Storage**:
   - S3 storage for survey questions and responses
   - Basic API integration for survey submission
   - Response tracking in the database

4. **Basic AI Analysis**:
   - Initial implementation of AI analysis service
   - Basic strength/weakness identification
   - Simple recommendations generation

### Areas Needing Enhancement:
1. Advanced analytics and visualization
2. Comprehensive reporting system
3. Improved AI analysis with more personalized insights
4. Better progress tracking and comparison tools
5. Enhanced user experience for both administrators and students

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to view comprehensive analytics dashboards with visualizations, so that I can gain deeper insights into student AI capabilities across different categories and demographics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display enhanced visualizations for category score distributions
2. WHEN viewing analytics THEN the system SHALL provide interactive charts showing score patterns across different AI competency categories
3. WHEN viewing analytics THEN the system SHALL display demographic breakdowns of scores (by education level, major, age group)
4. WHEN viewing analytics THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by workspace, survey, time period, and student demographics
5. WHEN an administrator exports analytics THEN the system SHALL generate downloadable reports in PDF and Excel formats with all visualizations included

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to generate enhanced individual student reports with more detailed AI capability assessments, so that I can provide more targeted feedback and development recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator selects a student's survey response THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive report with more detailed analysis than the current implementation
2. WHEN generating a student report THEN the system SHALL include visual score breakdowns by AI competency category
3. WHEN generating a student report THEN the system SHALL provide more specific strengths and areas for improvement based on question-level responses
4. WHEN generating a student report THEN the system SHALL include more tailored learning resources and development recommendations
5. WHEN a report is generated THEN the system SHALL provide enhanced options to download as PDF, share via email, or store in the system

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to compare survey results across different student groups or time periods, so that I can identify trends and measure the effectiveness of AI education programs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator accesses the analytics section THEN the system SHALL provide comparison tools for different student cohorts
2. WHEN comparing groups THEN the system SHALL display statistical differences in scores across categories
3. WHEN viewing trends THEN the system SHALL show changes in average scores over time with trend lines
4. WHEN analyzing results THEN the system SHALL highlight statistically significant differences between groups
5. WHEN comparing results THEN the system SHALL allow for filtering by various demographic and educational factors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a student, I want to receive more detailed and personalized feedback after completing an assessment, so that I can better understand my AI capabilities and areas for development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student completes an assessment THEN the system SHALL display an enhanced summary of their results with more detailed category breakdowns
2. WHEN showing results THEN the system SHALL present more specific strengths based on actual responses rather than generic feedback
3. WHEN showing results THEN the system SHALL provide more personalized recommendations for skill development with specific resources
4. WHEN a student views their results THEN the system SHALL offer a visual representation of their competency profile
5. WHEN a student views their results THEN the system SHALL allow them to download an enhanced PDF version of their report

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to customize the AI analysis parameters and reporting templates, so that I can tailor the assessment feedback to specific educational contexts or organizational needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator accesses system settings THEN the system SHALL provide options to customize AI analysis parameters
2. WHEN customizing analysis THEN the system SHALL allow modification of category weightings and threshold values
3. WHEN customizing reports THEN the system SHALL provide template editing capabilities for different report sections
4. WHEN customizing reports THEN the system SHALL allow adding custom branding and educational institution information
5. WHEN customizing the system THEN the system SHALL provide a preview of how the customized reports will appear
