# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the survey management system within workspaces by providing a streamlined workflow for administrators to upload Excel files containing survey questions, automatically generate survey forms, and efficiently monitor student responses and scores. The enhancement focuses on improving the current manual survey creation process by introducing file-based survey generation and comprehensive score tracking capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to upload Excel files containing survey questions to a workspace, so that I can quickly create surveys without manually entering each question.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator accesses a workspace THEN the system SHALL display an "Upload Survey" option
2. WHEN an administrator clicks "Upload Survey" THEN the system SHALL present a file upload interface that accepts Excel files (.xlsx, .xls)
3. WHEN an administrator uploads a valid Excel file THEN the system SHALL parse the file and extract survey questions, options, and metadata
4. IF the Excel file format is invalid THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages indicating the required format
5. WHEN the Excel file is successfully processed THEN the system SHALL preview the extracted questions for administrator review
6. WHEN the administrator confirms the preview THEN the system SHALL save the survey questions to the workspace

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to automatically generate survey forms from uploaded Excel files, so that I can create surveys efficiently without manual form building.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an Excel file is successfully uploaded THEN the system SHALL automatically generate a survey form with the extracted questions
2. WHEN generating the survey form THEN the system SHALL preserve question order, types (multiple choice, text, rating), and scoring criteria from the Excel file
3. WHEN the survey form is generated THEN the system SHALL assign a unique survey ID and shareable link
4. WHEN the administrator reviews the generated form THEN the system SHALL allow editing of individual questions, options, and settings
5. IF the administrator makes changes to the generated form THEN the system SHALL update the survey configuration accordingly
6. WHEN the administrator publishes the survey THEN the system SHALL activate the shareable link for student access

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to easily share survey links with students, so that they can access and complete the surveys efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a survey is published THEN the system SHALL generate a unique, secure shareable link
2. WHEN an administrator accesses the survey management page THEN the system SHALL display the shareable link with copy-to-clipboard functionality
3. WHEN an administrator clicks "Share Survey" THEN the system SHALL provide multiple sharing options (direct link, QR code, email template)
4. WHEN a student accesses the survey link THEN the system SHALL verify the survey is active and accessible
5. IF a survey is deactivated THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message to students attempting to access it
6. WHEN sharing a survey THEN the system SHALL include survey title, estimated completion time, and basic instructions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a student, I want to complete surveys through an intuitive interface, so that I can provide accurate responses efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student accesses a survey link THEN the system SHALL display the survey introduction and personal information form
2. WHEN a student submits personal information THEN the system SHALL validate required fields and proceed to survey questions
3. WHEN displaying survey questions THEN the system SHALL show 5 questions per page with clear navigation
4. WHEN a student answers questions THEN the system SHALL save responses automatically and update progress indicator
5. WHEN a student completes all questions THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation page and submit responses
6. IF a student's session is interrupted THEN the system SHALL allow resuming from the last saved question
7. WHEN a student submits the survey THEN the system SHALL redirect to a thank you page with completion confirmation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to monitor student responses and scores in real-time, so that I can track survey completion and analyze results immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN students submit survey responses THEN the system SHALL update the workspace dashboard with real-time statistics
2. WHEN an administrator views the survey monitoring page THEN the system SHALL display completion rates, response counts, and score distributions
3. WHEN an administrator selects a specific survey THEN the system SHALL show detailed response analytics including individual student scores
4. WHEN viewing student responses THEN the system SHALL calculate and display scores based on the Excel file's scoring criteria
5. WHEN an administrator exports results THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive reports in Excel and PDF formats
6. WHEN monitoring surveys THEN the system SHALL provide filtering options by completion status, score ranges, and submission dates

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to manage multiple surveys within a workspace, so that I can organize different assessment types and track their performance separately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator accesses a workspace THEN the system SHALL display all surveys associated with that workspace
2. WHEN viewing the survey list THEN the system SHALL show survey status (draft, active, completed), response counts, and creation dates
3. WHEN an administrator creates a new survey THEN the system SHALL allow categorization and tagging for organization
4. WHEN managing surveys THEN the system SHALL provide options to duplicate, archive, or delete surveys
5. IF an administrator deletes a survey THEN the system SHALL require confirmation and move it to a recoverable trash state
6. WHEN organizing surveys THEN the system SHALL support search and filtering by title, status, creation date, and tags

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to define Excel file format standards, so that survey uploads are consistent and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes Excel files THEN it SHALL support a standardized format with defined columns for questions, options, types, and scoring
2. WHEN an invalid Excel format is uploaded THEN the system SHALL provide a downloadable template showing the correct format

4. WHEN extracting scoring criteria THEN the system SHALL read point values and weighting from designated Excel columns
5. IF Excel parsing encounters errors THEN the system SHALL provide line-by-line error reporting with specific correction guidance
6. WHEN validating Excel content THEN the system SHALL check for required fields, duplicate questions, and invalid scoring configurations
